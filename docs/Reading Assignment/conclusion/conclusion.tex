\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As shown in subsection \ref{ssec:results}, there is a pretty big spread in the benchmark results for the smaller predictors, due to differing methodologies used in the different papers.
Therefore making quantitative comparisons a bit harder.
For a big predictor the combined variety shows the best results, with a \SI{98.1}{\percent} accuracy for a predictor with the size of \SI{64}{\kilo\byte}.
For the smaller predictors the results are a little muddier, but Combination still comes out ahead, with \SI{95.2}{\percent} with a size of \SI{0.5}{\kilo\byte}.
The combined predictor used, consists of one local and one gshare predictor.
As shown in the figures \ref{fig:performance-norm-big} and \ref{fig:performance-norm-small}, the gshare predictor gets outperformed by the YAGS predictor, so if we replace the gshare with the YAGS, the combined predictor might perform even better.
