\textbf{\textit{Abstract -} Programs can contain a lot of branches. These branches can disrupt the flow of the program and therefore cause a slowdown. In this paper we describe the mechanisms behind four different branch prediction techniques namely: two-level adaptive training, hybrid prediction, YAGS, and neural branch prediction. A final trade-off is made between their accuracies and their relative size-performance ratio based on the data provided by the authors of the branch predictors. This comparison is a little complicated due to the fact that different authors use different benchmarks. However, based on a comparison between relatively similar benchmarks it's shown that hybrid prediction performs the best for large predictor sizes with an accuracy of 98.1\%.}
