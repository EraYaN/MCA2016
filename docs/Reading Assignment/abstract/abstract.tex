\textbf{\textit{Abstract}-- This paper discusses the workings of four different branch prediction techniques in detail: two-level adaptive training, hybrid prediction, YAGS and neural branch prediction. Their accuracies are compared for different predictor sizes using data from the papers that originally suggested the prediction schemes. A direct comparison is made difficult by the fact that the different papers use different benchmarks and data collection methods. If that problem is ignored hybrid prediction would perform the best for large predictor sizes with 98.1\% accuracy.}
