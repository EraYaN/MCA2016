% metric is SPEC95 branch prediction correctness (between 0-1) Quantitative
% metric is size on-chip Qualitative

\section{Comparison}
\subsection{Metrics}
As a comparison metric the branch prediction accuracy is the most obvious.
For all of the talked about solutions there are figures for SPEC benchmarks.

A second good metric is the size of each of the solutions and their relative performance.
\subsection{Results}

%TODO table to SPEC (Quantative)

%TODO piece of text for size.
