\section{Description of the Evaluated Solutions}
Based on the year of publishing the respective papers are discussed in the following sections.
Therefore section \ref{two-level} starts off with \textit{two-level adaptive training}, published in 1991.
Secondly, in Section \ref{hybrid} the hybrid predictor is explained. In section \ref{ssec:yags} the YAGS predictor is examined while lastly the neural branch predictor is explained in section \ref{sec:neural}.

%The proposed branch prediction schemes of each paper will be explained to serve as context for the quantitative and qualitative comparison that follows this section. Attention will also be paid to general branch prediction concepts, especially in the older papers.

\input{twolevel/twolevel}

\input{combined/combined}
%Describe the main idea of the solution in [1] and the way it works. Use your own words and in case really needed you can include figures from the original paper while giving proper reference. The text has to be self contained as the reader should be able to understand the essence of the proposed approach without reading the original paper.

\input{yags/yags}

\input{neural/neural}

\input{comparison/comparison}
%Discuss in a critical way the analysed solutions. For each of them highlight pros and cons. Provide a qualitative (and in case possible also a quantitative) comparison of the discussed approaches. If applicable describe the way you would try to address the problem and explain why do you think your solution could give better results.
