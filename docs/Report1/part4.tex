\section{Environment}
The configuration for this processor is mainly for applications where power consumption is less important that raw performance.
Think bigger embedded systems (in vehicles for example) or desktops.
Especially fir which can be used for filtering applications.
When you need said function in a low power environment you will use a special function unit on the target device (DSP).
The functionality of engine would be use close to an actual engine, thus power is not a problem.
Most modern alternators deliver plenty of power to run even the biggest desktop size chips.
The trend in cars is towards more powerful hardware to enable all kinds of smart features.

The best performance was achieved using a single relatively big single cluster that is not terribly power efficient, but achieves high performance.
That especially in for example automotive can be crucial to bring latencies down and safety up.
