\section{Conclusion}
In the end the project group considers the balanced design the best design of the three. 
It is only about 20000 cycles slower than the high performance design while using less than half of the energy. 
They don't differ significantly in area. 
The low power/area design is small and efficient compared to the other two designs but more than twice as slow as the balanced design and therefore not viable for most purposes.
