\section{Introduction}
In the first assignment two benchmark programs were analysed and a VEX design was made balancing performance and resource usage for the execution of these programs. For the second assignment the scope is somewhat enlarged. Taking four benchmarks instead of two, the task is now to create three System on a Chip designs using $\rho$-VEX processors in an asymmetric multicore configuration. In contrast with assignment 1 they are not only simulated, they are also synthesized and run on an FPGA where not only performance but also power and area consumption are measured. The three designs should represent a high performance configuration, a low power/area configuration and a design that balances performance and resource usage. Using $\rho$-VEX technology a design using reconfigurable cores is also a possibility. In this report the benchmarks will first be analysed to give an indication of what the focus of the design should be after which the three resulting designs will be discussed.
